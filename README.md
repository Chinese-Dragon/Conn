## Introduction

When writing networking layers, it´s common to end with a lot of boilerplate or repeated code.
There are currently some libraries that one can use in order to improve code readability and to avoid writing boilerplate, but they are usually so bloated that one doesn´t use the half of what that library offers.
On the other hand, there are some other libraries that are lightweight, but they often fall short when you need more advanced functionality.
Conn is the library that resolves this issue. It is very lightweight (118 lines counting empty lines until now), but it is still highly modular while it doesn't require the developer to write any boilerplate. 

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

Conn is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
